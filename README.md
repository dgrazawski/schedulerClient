# schedulerClient

iOS client for my Scheduler App for viewing Schedules without registration on your iPhone.
Using Swift, SwiftUI and SwiftData. Network layer written with Combine framework.
Later i want to rewrite the layer to be generic.

To make the project run you need to change base URL in the NetworkManager file.
